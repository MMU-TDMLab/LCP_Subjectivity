# Agree to Disagree: Exploring Subjectivity in Lexical Complexity

This repository contains code and data associated with the paper:

Agree to Disagree: Exploring Subjectivity in Lexical Complexity, M. Shardlow, In proceedings of LREC, Marseille, 2022.

The code is stored as jupyter notebook files. Each file should run independently of all others. Intermeediary results are stored as pickled dataframes (.pkl).

The source data for the shared tasks are stored in the CWI_2018 and LCP_2021 folders respectively. The LCP_2021 folder contains the raw mechanical turk files that were produced during the annotation round.

The Figures directory is left blank as running the code will save figures there.
